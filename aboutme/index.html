    <h2>AKA: Sym</h2>
    <p>Howdy y'all! My name is Symeon Rohrer or you can just call me Sym. I'm 23 years old and from San Antonio, Texas. I'm currenrly living in Rexbrg, Idaho and taking classes full time. I'm studying software engineering and I'm excited to learn anything and everything related to it. I'm extremly new to the program and have little to now previous knowledge but learn something everyday and feel comfortable with it.</p>
    <p>I was born into the church but haven't always fully appreciated everything that it is. I'm glad to report that I'm much more grateful now and working on serving a mission closer to the end of this year!</p>
    <p>If I ever get free time, I love to play sports, mostly volleyball and basketball. However, anything active will keep me happy. I also, enjoy letting my inner nerd breathe every once in awhile and I'll play Dugeons & Dragons.</p>
    <p>I'm extremly excited to be in the Web Fundamentals course. I work so closely with websites every single day, it will be so cool to understand more fully what I am looking at when I do. I know there is so much to be learned here and I'm ready to learn it right along side you all.</p>
